			<h2>ABOUT OUR SITE:</h2>
			<p>REPEATER: an online customizable metronome is a student project created by the above students from UC Santa Cruz
				for the class ART101 during Winter 2021.
				<br>
				<br>
				REPEATER is a highly customizable website that allows users to upload their own sounds and define how often they play,
				choose a helpful animation to help visualize the timing,
				and does the BPM to seconds calculation for you, so it's convenient to use as a metronome.
				REPEATER's biggest strength is that it is highly customizable so that it can be
				utilized in a variety of ways and tailored to a user's preferences.
				<br>
				<br>
				Shoutouts to our wonderful TA Brock and instructor Wes for helping us
				learn how to create this site.
				<br>
				<br>
				Known Bugs:
				<br>
				Some audio clips and animations may not seem like they're playing at all at shorter (0.25s / 240 BPM)
				intervals. They actually are playing, but they're being refreshed too fast (playing only the blank beginning)
				because of the way we coded them (sound and animations don't overlap, they stop the previous instance).
